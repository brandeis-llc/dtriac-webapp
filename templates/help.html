You can do a simple search on the text of documents in the index just by typing
in a search term, replace spaces in the term with underscores:

<pre class="example">
communication
graph_coupling
</pre>

To search for particular index field prefix the term with the field and
separate field and term by a colon. Fields can be complex in that they refer to
sub structure in a relation:

<pre class="example">
organization:National_Science_Foundation
technology:communication
event:connected
relation.pred:connected
relation.arg1:communication
</pre>

Recognized fields are <code>author</code>, <code>technology</code>,
<code>person</code>, <code>location</code>, <code>organization</code>,
<code>event</code>, <code>relation.pred</code>, <code>relation.arg1</code>
and <code>relation.arg2</code>. For all these fields there are abbreviations,
the abbreviations are the first letter for the simple fields
(<code>author</code> etcetera) and <code>pred</code>, <code>arg1</code>
and <code>arg2</code> for the relation fields:

<pre class="example">
t:communication
pred:connected
</pre>

You can create complex queries:

<pre class="example">
location:Italy person:markov
</pre>

The query above will be interpreted as an AND query. You can make this explicit
by adding AND to the beginning of the query, you can also use OR to make the
query an OR query:

<pre class="example">
AND location:Italy person:markov lives
OR location:Italy person:markov lives
</pre>

At the moment it is not possible to mix an's and or's, and the following will
not give the results you might expect.

<pre class="example">
(location:Italy AND (person:markov OR lives))
</pre>
